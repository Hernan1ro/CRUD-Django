Using the CRUD system
The CRUD system allows you to create, view, update, and delete entries in a simple database table. You can access the CRUD system by clicking on the "CRUD" link in the navigation bar.

From the CRUD homepage, you can view a list of all entries in the database table. You can click on an individual entry to view its details, or click the "Add" button to create a new entry.

To update or delete an entry, click on the entry to view its details and then click the "Update" or "Delete" button.
